**Key Features:**

Uses an adjacency-list–based graph representation.



Each station is mapped to a numeric ID for efficient graph traversal.



Edge weights represent travel distance between stations.



Supports large metro networks with hundreds of nodes.



**Shortest Path Computation (Dijkstra):**Implements an optimized priority queue–based version.



**Multi-Station Traversal (Greedy TSP Module):**Calculates an efficient route through multiple required stations.



**Color-Aware Route Interpretation**
